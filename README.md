# AI DeepSearch Agent

An intelligent, multi-step research assistant built with LangChain and LangGraph.
This AI agent automates deep information gathering by scraping the web, compiling historical insights, and generating a structured PDF report with timestamps.
Designed for students, researchers, and personal study, the agent helps simplify complex topics and produce well-organized, ready-to-reference research documents.

# Project Overview 🚀 

The AI DeepSearch Agent is a personalized AI system created to perform advanced online research with minimal user input.
When given a search topic, the agent:

1. Scrapes information from the web using multiple search and retrieval tools.

2. Analyzes and compiles the extracted data into clear, meaningful insights.

3. Provides historical context and timeline information if available.

4. Generates a complete PDF report that includes:

Key findings

Sources (when available)

Time-stamped sections

Summaries and structured breakdowns

# Tech Stack

1. LangChain: for tool integration, search wrappers, and document processing

2. LangGraph: for building the multi-agent, multi-step reasoning workflow

3. Python – core development

4. PDF generation library (pprint/pformat)

5. Search tools for querying web data (Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo)

# Motivation 💡

The project was built primarily for personal learning, and has proven extremely effective for deep research across different subjects.
It has been used efficiently and effectively to handle complex search topics and produce easy-to-read summaries that save time and improve understanding.
